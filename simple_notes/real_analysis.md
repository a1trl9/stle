### The Lebesgue integral: basic properties and conver- gence theorems

The definition of support: a set, where f does not vanish.

**Lemma 1.2**

- littleword's principles.. Egorov..
- get a closed measurable subset A...
- for 2Mm(E-A\_{\epsilon}), think E is bounded...

**Theorem 1.4**

> We note that the above convergence theorem is a statement..

Try to link it to the property of uniform convergence -> allow interchange of integrals.
